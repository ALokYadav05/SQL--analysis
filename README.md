## How To Use  
1. Restore or connect to the DVD Rental database (e.g., `dvdrental`) in PostgreSQL/pgAdmin.  
2. Open one of the SQL files in the `queries/` folder in pgAdmin (or your SQL client).  
3. Execute each query and optionally save the results (to CSV or screenshot) into the `outputs/` folder.  
4. Review and interpret the results — use your own comments or notes in the `docs/` folder if you like.

## Query Files Description  
- **file1_basic_queries.sql**: Contains 5 basic queries (e.g., simple SELECTs, COUNTs)  
- **file2_intermediate_queries.sql**: 5 queries that involve filtering, simple joins  
- **file3_advanced_queries.sql**: 5 queries involving GROUP BY, HAVING, sub-queries  
- **file4_very_advanced_queries.sql**: 5 challenging queries (complex aggregates, multiple joins, advanced logic)  

## Insights & Analysis  
In the `docs/` folder you can include a report (e.g., `Project_Report.md`) where you:  
- Summarise what each query reveals  
- Point out interesting patterns/trends you discovered in the data  
- Suggest next steps or deeper analysis (e.g., predictive modelling, customer segmentation)  

## Technologies Used  
- PostgreSQL  
- pgAdmin (or any SQL client)  
- Git + GitHub for version control  
- (Optional) CSV exports and documentation in Markdown
